# Implementing GH-Pages with React  
Project using the GitHub Pages to deploy a React project. This is a learning process through hands on development.

# Learning to Redeploy with GitHub Pages.
Using the normal methods to push into the repository. 
I redeployed using "npm run deploy", this is a script put into the package as "gh-pages -d build". This allows me to deploy the site again with changes to the repository as it pushes the branch gh-pages.

# Learning to interact with the API
After seperating the project into components, the API was accessed using Axios and fetching the corresponding JSON data. The data was found by changing the endpoint and trying to specifiy specific resources.
