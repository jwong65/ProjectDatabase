Project using the GitHub Pages to deploy a React project. This is a learning process through hands on development.

# Learning to Redeploy with GitHub Pages.
Using the normal methods to push into the repository. 
I redeployed using "npm run deploy", this is a script put into the package as "gh-pages -d build". This allows me to deploy the site again with changes to the repository as it pushes the branch gh-pages.
